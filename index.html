        I have lived in several countries growing up and have met lots of
        interesting people. I love discovering new hobbies and front-end
        development has been a great find. I studied programming at university
        and have experience with JAVA, C++, C and I am learning about Python and
        C# at the moment, however, I enjoy web development the most.

        I used to teach and have a very creative mindset. I have had a painting
        in the Smithsonian Museum and I love looking for new ways to use my
        artistic skills. In my spare time I will always be working on a new art
        project.

        I live on a farm and my surroundings and the animals that live here as
        my inspiration. My cat, Kirby, is my editor and boss so his approval is
        everything to me.
